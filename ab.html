	<h2>Abigail Castaneda</h2>
		<p style="text-align: left;"> Hi, my name is Abi. I am a 15-year-old from San Jose, Ca. I attend DCP El Primero as a rising sophomore. I found out about SMASH from my math teacher. I applied because I knew this was going to be a huge opportunity. Another reason I chose this program was to explore other subjects to be sure of what I really want to become. My experience in SMASH so far has been very exciting because I got to learn about new subjects and I have discovered new interests. At the moment I aspire to be an architect because it is a combination of STEM and art. Finally, my biggest inspiration in life is my family because they support me and I will eventually be the one to take care of them.  </p>

	<h2>Taliyah Cato</h2>
		<p style="text-align: left;"> My name is TaLiyah Cato, I am a rising sophmore at Sacred Heart Cathedral Prep. I was born and raised in San Francisco, California. In my previous year in high school, I was interested in physics but my overall favorite subjects are science and math. I found out about SMASH through my middle school robotics teacher. I am interested in Design Architecture and Engineering because I have attended many programs and I have connected with architecture and engineering the most. My mother is my inspiration because she motivates me to work hard and in the end, I will be the one providing for her.   </p>

	<h2>Nam Le</h2>
		<p style="text-align: left;"> My name is Nam and I attend Gunderson High in San Jose, Ca. I am 15 years old and a rising sophomore. I am interested in the medical field, I am currently thinking of neuroscience. I learned about SMASH when the site director, Alicia Parise, came to my school and did a presentation about the program. I decided to apply because I thought it would be fun and beneficial for my future. So far SMASH has been a great experience because it has allowed me to learn more about myself, what I want to do in the future, and it allows me to socialize more. Above all, SMASH has been an amazing and wonderful time; like, I cannot stress just how much fun I have had throughout this program. </p>
