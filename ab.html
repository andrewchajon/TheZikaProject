	<h2>Abigail Castaneda</h2>
		<p> Hi, my name is Abi, I am a 15-year-old form San Jose, Ca. I attend DCP El Primero as a rising sophomore and this is my first year at SMASH Stanford. I found out about SMASH from the daily announcements we have at school. I did not consider applying until my math teacher suggested I find out more information to see if I like it or not. I took his suggestion and met up with the schoolâ€™s community partnership manager. After learning more about the program I genuinely started to get curious and interested in SMASH therefore, I applied. The subjects sounded fascinating and I knew this was going to be a huge opportunity as a student. My experience in SMASH so far has been very exciting because I got to learn new subjects and I discovered new interests. At the moment I aspire to be an architect because I enjoy a career that has a combination of STEM and art. I also discovered here in SMASH that I have an interest in computer science and in emergency medicine. Another reason I chose this program was to explore other subjects to be sure of what I really want to become. Finally, my biggest inspiration in life is my family because they have been the only people that have supported and loved me no matter my mistakes. They are the reason I want to be someone in life because at the end of my journey I will be the one taking care of them.  </p>

	<h2>Taliyah Cato</h2>
		<p> My name is TaLiyah Cato, I am a rising tenth grader at Sacred Heart Cathedral Prep. I was born and raised in San Francisco, California. In my previous year in high school, I was interested in physics but overall my favorite subjects are science and math. I found out about SMASH through my middle school robotics teacher. I am interested in Design Architecture and Engineering because I have attended many programs and I connect with architecture and engineering the most. My inspiration is my mother because she motivates me to work hard and in the end, I will be the one providing for her.   </p>

	<h2>Nam Le</h2>
		<p> My name is Nam and I attend Gunderson High in San Jose, Ca. I am 15 years old and a rising sophomore. I am interested in the medical field, I am currently thinking of neuroscience. I learned about SMASH when the site director, Alicia Parise, came to my school and did a presentation about the program. I decided to apply because I thought it would be fun and beneficial for my future. So far SMASH has been a great experience because it has allowed me to learn more about myself, what I want to do in the future, and socializing more. Above all, SMASH has been an amazing and wonderful time, like I cannot stress just how much fun I have had throughout this program. </p>
